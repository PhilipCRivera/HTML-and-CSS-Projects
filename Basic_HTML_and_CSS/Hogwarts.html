	<h1>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardy</h1>
	   <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Hogwarts was founded by two wizards and two witches in &#57;&#57;&#48;&#65;&#68;
	   <br>At some point in the tenth century, four of the greatest witches and wizards that ever lived founded Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
	   <br> Their names were Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin.
	   <br> As The Sorting Hat told us, their reason for doing so was because they had the ‘selfsame yearning, to make the world’s best magic school’, and once they did, each created their own house to represent a personality and skill that they wanted to nurture. 
	   <br>Gryffindor students embodied bravery and chivalry; Ravenclaw, intelligence and wit; Hufflepuff, loyalty and fair play; and Slytherin, the values of being sly and cunning.
